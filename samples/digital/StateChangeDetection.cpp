  State change detection (edge detection)

 Often, you don't need to know the state of a digital input all the time,
 but you just need to know when the input changes from one state to another.
 For example, you want to know when a button goes from OFF to ON.  This is called
 state change detection, or edge detection.

 This example shows how to detect when a button or button changes from off to on
 and on to off.

 The circuit:
 * pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
 * 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground (or use the built-in LED on
   most Arduino boards)

/* Blink without Delay

 Turns on and off a light emitting diode (LED) connected to a digital
 pin, without using the delay() function.  This means that other code
 can run at the same time without being interrupted by the LED code.

 The circuit:
 * Use the onboard LED.
 * Note: Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO 
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino model, check
  the Technical Specs of your board  at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products
